**Abstract**

Virtual reality has been slowly increasing in popularity and as a topic of conversation as it becomes steadily more refined and usable. 
Formerly, VR was presumably relegated to the world of gaming but it now has more tangible, daily applications. 
As VR improves and becomes increasingly integrated into reality, policymakers should be concerned about the cyber implications. 
Cyber conflict is the new horizon of global threats and any technology that contributes to that space should be on policymakersâ€™ radars.
This project seeks to analyze the current news coverage of and conversation on virtual reality, particularly as it relates to cybersecurity. 
Is the intersection of virtual reality and cybersecurity well-discussed? If not, what areas of focus are predominent in the virtual reality space? How has this conversation changed in the past or how might it change in the future?
By analyzing the current conversation on virtual reality, we can better understand the industry, gaps in coverage, and public sentiment.
